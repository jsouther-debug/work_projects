## part 2 essay

I started by encrypting a message with a symmetric encryption using gpg, it took a lot of googling to figure out how to do what I was trying to do, but it did help me realize that gpg was capable of doing both symmetric and asymmetric encryption. I knew that from the manual but that wasn't easy to understand for me. I then encrypted the passphrase to decrypt the message file in another file and encrypted it with Dr. Stanley's public key. Then I am about to push all of these instructions through a readme in the crypto directory. I used aes-256 symmetric encryption for the message. The key is the passphrase which is encrypted with your public key. GPG can use a number of algorithms but aes256 is the default symmetric one. The strengths of my approach were I learned a lot of random things and different ways you could encrypt something on the internet and using different types of software. The weaknesses to my approach were it took a while to figure out what I thought would work best for what I was trying to do. When I did find what I though would work best for me, it took even longer to get familiar enough with it to do what I wanted. So those are the strengths and weaknesses to my approach.
