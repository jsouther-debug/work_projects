 As far as I know, the only thing that doesn't work at the moment is my alu.h and alu.cpp, which were renamed to bad_*. I can not figure out why they do not work, it passes all of the google tests, but goes to crap in the simulator. Other then that, I never finished the DirectAddress files because I ran out of time and got busy. I think everything else works correctly, at least with my binary.
